# Sums in Loop

Now we are given several pairs of values and we want to calculate sum for each pair.

Input data will contain the total count of pairs to process in the first line.

The following lines will contain pairs themselves - one pair at each line.

Answer should contain the results separated by spaces.


Example:

data:

3

100 8

15 245

1945 54


answer:

108 260 1999


# result
js

look in console

erlang

task:sum3(3, [{100, 8}, {15, 245}, {1945, 54}]).

elixir

Task.sum3(3, [{100, 8}, {15, 245}, {1945, 54}])
